## **Kanzepts Recipe App**

I am building this app with **ReactJS** 🛠️ for the functionalities, **Tailwind CSS** 💄 for styling/designing, and **DaisyUI** 🌻 for additional components.

The construction of this recipe app is still ongoing 🚧 but I already want to show some of its features.

I am using data from [Spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com).

The main objective of building this app is to be able to use it at home, where we can:

- Add ingredients and their measurements
- Adjust measurements for bigger servings
- Provide detailed instructions
- Upload Images of the Food
